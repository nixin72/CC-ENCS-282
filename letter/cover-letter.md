<div><b>Dear Mr. Grenier,</b></div>

<p>I am writing to you because I am interested in applying for the position of Junior Programmer-Analyst. After completing a 3 year college diploma in Computer Science, <b>my passion for the field has driven me to pursue a bachelor's degree,</b> where I am now studying in my first semester at Concordia university. Doing a 3 year technical degree gave me a <b>very solid foundation in software development,</b> teaching me about system analysis, architecture, standardization, development and the whole SDLC. Now studying the theory and learning to think in new and different ways, I believe I would be a valuable member of your team.</p>

<p>When I first began studying Computer Science, I struggled with it a lot; by the end of my first year in college, I almost dropped out. Not knowing what else to do though, I stuck with it through the year and got a coop placement for the summer where I worked in IT. The work there was slow and repetitive, but it was then that it first dawned on me what I was doing. <b>I realized that I could use programming to automate</b> a lot of what I was already doing in my day-to-day. So taking a blind leap, I dug into batch scripting, learning how I could image computers with just a couple mouse-clicks. Ultimately, it was a lot of copy/paste off the internet, but it made me want to learn more. <b>I began my second year eager to learn</b> and working harder than ever. In my second summer, I found myself working as a full-stack web developer for a company called TechInsights, and I loved programming.</p>

<p>Today, I am always working on something. <b>I have many side projects on the go,</b> but the one I'm perhaps most proud of is my compiler. Programming languages have always fascinated me, and so I decided to build one. Now, after months of playing around in my spare time I now have something functional. Learning about programming languages and compilers has led me to a passion in them, and I'm <b>constantly looking for new languages now that pique my interest.</b></p>

<p>Since compilers need to be so well made, learning about them has led me to exploring more about software tools and quality. Compilers have become a standard in quality for me and made me look very critically at software for things that can be improved. Because of my <b>critical approach and high standards, I'm able to make logical and objective choices</b> without being influenced as much by my own biases; I think this makes me an excellent candidate for this job.</p>

<p>If you are interested, <b>I would like to schedule an interview with you in the near future.<b></p>
